# Plong
Classic pong game with additional features.

Gameplay:
- A point is scored when the ball enters the "end zone" of the opponent.
- After a point is scored, the ball immediately resets to (0,0) and moves in the direction towards the player who scored.
- Use E and S to control Player 1 (left) and the Up and Down arrow keys to control Player 2 (Right)
- Scoring a point gives you a boost by slightly elongating your paddle.
- The ball speeds up slightly every time a player hits it.
